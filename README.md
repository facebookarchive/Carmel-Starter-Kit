# Carmel WebVR Starter kit Samples

Samples used to demonstrate how to get started with WebVR on Carmel.

## Running Samples

First, run `npm install` to get the npm dependencies used for hosting the samples locally.

Run `npm start` to start a local http server on port 8000.  

You can navigate to, http://<ip address>:8000/index.html, to access the samples on a Gear VR enabled mobile device.

The top category of links will launch each sample into the Carmel Technical Preview.

The bottom category of links can be used to launch each sample directly in your browser if the sample supports rendering monoscopically.
